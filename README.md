# Profile Wesbite

A simple profile website to showcase a little about me.

## Description

Using Django Framework, I created a simple website. On the front-end I use Bootstrap, to make customizing the pages as smooth as possible. For the domain it uses namecheap, and for the server I use Amazon Lightsail along with Nginx. The website can be reach at this link: https://www.tthmung.xyz
